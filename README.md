# E-Exam
Students register to take the exam with their information and picture. Professors are responsible to add the questions of the exam
Admin is responsible to verify students’ documents and starting the exam for students. 
Before this system, everything is done manually. The professors prepare questions and print the exams. The correcting students’ answers process takes a long time. Making certificates are done manually for each student (adding student picture, score, and name), so this process also takes a long time then it must take. The students solve the exams in a big hall which eases cheating answers.
